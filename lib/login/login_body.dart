// This file is no longer used as the login functionality has been moved to login.dart
// The new login implementation uses Firebase Authentication and doesn't require Formz
// This fixes the "Formz undefined" error by removing the unused import

// The login screen is now implemented in /app/lib/login/login.dart with:
// - Firebase Authentication
// - Modern UI design
// - Proper error handling
// - Email/password validation
// - Account creation functionality
